Game logic notes
- speed is related to value of box. higher value, faster speed.
- speed is halved and parachute appears once reaches certain Y value.
- if bomb is clicked, value is deducted and another parachute is generated with same value after a delay.
- Show value of parachute once clicked
- replace with 3d models
- First focus on 10 clash parachutes
- Create basic end game screen (leaderboard)
